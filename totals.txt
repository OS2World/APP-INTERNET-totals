totals - a simple program designed to determine "statistics" from
         Penguin FTP Daemon. Written by Tom Sorensen.
         tom@wc51.residence.gatech.edu

Requires: Penguin FTP Daemon, v1.00 or higher.
          Transfer logging (-f) be turned on.

This program simply goes through your transfer.log file (or whatever you
named it if you used the -F parameter on penftpd) and totals the number
of bytes sent and received. It then displays these totals along with the
first date present in the logfile.

Additionally, you can have it give you info on a single day or all days.
You can also suppress the overall total information.

Usage:
    totals d:\tcpip\penftpd\transfer.log [-d######] [-D] [-t]

d:\tcpip...transfer.log: the name and location of the transfer log file.
                         You only need to put the path in if it's not in
                         the current directory (ie- totals transfer.log
                         will work too)

-d###### : Show statistics for date ######. The format of the ###### is
           dependant upon your country. In the US, it's generally
           MMDDYY. In Europe, Austrailia, and many other places it's
           DDMMYY. In Japan and other areas of Asia it's YYMMDD. In any
           case it's the same format as what's in transfer.log. Do NOT
           put any -'s or /'s in this, and do not put a space in between
           the d and the date.

-D       : Show statistics for ALL dates. This can be lengthy.

-t       : Suppress showing of overall totals. It won't show the grand
           totals at the end. Basically it's so that you can see ONLY a
           single day.

What use is all this? No idea. I wanted the information though, so I
wrote this program for myself and as an excercise. I had originally
planned to do it in AWK, but AWK proved, well, awkward :). I also don't
know Perl and didn't feel like learning it at the time. Finally, the
date information would not have been possible with either as far as I
know, since it requires National Language Support (part of the OS/2 API)
to get some of the information.

This program is completely free. The source code is included and is
released to the public domain. Although I don't plan on ever releasing a
new version (unless the format of transfer.log changes), I'd like to
know if you change the source code or create another "add-on" for
Penguin FTPD.

This program was compiled with Watcom C++ 10.0A. Since I'm still not
totally familiar with the compiler & linker options, I didn't get this
to compile as small as CSet could make it. Even so, it's only 19k. If
you can get this smaller with Watcom (should be possible if you can
enable dynamic linking), please e-mail me the make files & link files
you used.

See the .c file for various other disclaimers and such.
